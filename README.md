This was  really fun to make! Thank you for the tutorial @JFincher42!!

I'm wanting to build a Jackbox Games style party game, "Wackronyms," based on
a tabletop word game my Dad created when I was living at home.

So far I know C/C++ and Python, though I've done a little Javascript as well. I
currently develop Python code at work, so I thought I'd check out the options for game
creation in Python, since I thought it'd be easier than C/C++ and also help me
sharpen my work skills.

Google searches led me to this fantastic tutorial on the pygame library:
https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/

It was a great learning experience! The tutorial focuses on development of an arcade-
style game. Aspects of it will carry over, such as initializing the game engine,
drawing the screen, screen updates, frame rate, importing/using graphics, OOP game
design principles, sound effects, etc.

I will for sure be coming back here to reference code/examples/principles I've learned
whilst building Wackronyms.
